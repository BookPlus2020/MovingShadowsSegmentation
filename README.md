# MovingShadowsSegmentation
We give a detailed dataset for moving cast shadows segmentation.  It includes 14 scenes: five indoor scenes and nine outdoor scenes.
The dataset used in the paper can be obtained from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1zBSboaGFD-8pxOxWxaiBfA   Extraction code: 63b7 .

Specially, we got help from some researchers and show sincere thanks to the authors and their papers as follows:
